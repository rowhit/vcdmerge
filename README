Try to read&merge two .vcd files and output a third one, 
that has the same signals but X where the inputs don't match up. 

how to handle changes?
a linked list, or a marker bit in value itself, 
and iterate over the whole tree to dump changes. 

may want to do a generic diff tool, wot 
outputs 0 for equal signals and 1 where they differ...

to hilight functional differences...
